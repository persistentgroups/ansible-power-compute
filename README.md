## Ansible playbooks for deploying Openstack Compute
The ansible playbooks are used to add a compute node to an existing Openstack control plane.Currently tested on Ubuntu 14.04,Ubuntu 16.04 and PowerKVM3.1

Detailed documentation on configurations is available at 
[docs](https://github.com/persistentgroups/ansible-power-compute/tree/master/docs)

### Required Environment
* Openstack control plane
* Deployer node for running ansible playbooks
* Target node for compute installation

Below steps are performed on deployer node to install compute on target node
## 1. prerequisites
#### 1.1. Get the source code
#### 1.2. Install ansible and its dependencies

```
apt-get install python-pip python-dev
cd ansible-power-compute
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### 1.3. Add target node ips in /etc/hosts
```
<compute_ip> compute1
<controller_ip> controller1
<ceph_monitor_ip> monitor1  #if nova has to be configured with ceph backend
```
#### 1.4. Configure Ansible playbooks
```
cd ansible-power-compute
```
Provide corresponding hosts in `envs/setup/compute/hosts`

Example: 
```
# cat envs/setup/compute/hosts
[controller]
controller1
[db_arbiter]
compute1
[compute]
compute1
[ceph_monitors]
monitor1
```
Provide compute node configurations in `envs/setup/compute/group_vars/all.yml` 
```
